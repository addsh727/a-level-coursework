# A-Level Coursework
This project of mine is an eCommerce website for Zedâ€™s Galaxy which I submitted as coursework for the A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment with the AQA exam board.
This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery) & PHP with a MySQL database as the backend.

A showcase of my project on YouTube is available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoMhAx1hylZZJw7NuMwyvaeryQvakKA2b).

## Installation:

Create a new `public_html` folder.

Clone this repository into `public_html` using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) by running:

    $ git clone https://github.com/addsh727/a-level-coursework.git

...or alternatively, download the files and extract using [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

---

Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)  (Video tutorials can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=xampp+installation)).

Navigate to the XAMMP directory folder, then locate the `htdocs` folder and drag the folder `public_html` into `htdocs`.

---

Start running the MySQL server in XAMPP.

Open a browser tab and open the following URL:

    http://localhost/phpmyadmin

On the sidebar to the left, click `New` to create a new database.

Nagivate to the `Import` tab on the horizontal navbar, then import the preset database `s2106630.sql`.

Paste the following URL into the browser:

    http://localhost/public_html

And you should now have access to the eCommerce website!

## Setup PayPal API for Payment:

Video tutorials can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=paypal+payment+api).

For the PayPal API to process transactions correctly, you must first obtain a PayPal client ID by through PayPal Developer.

Once obtained, locate `checkout.php`, then search for `$token`. 

Paste your PayPal client ID therein which will connect the website's payment gateway to your PayPal Developer Dashboard.

## Emails:

To configure the email templates, nagivate to `public_html/php` folder.

Open the `send----.php` email templates. Edit the `$from` variables to the email address from which you wish to send emails from along with others if needed.
